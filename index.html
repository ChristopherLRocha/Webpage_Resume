        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is my resume built in HTML for hiring managers to look at.</p>

        <p><strong>A bit about myself:</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Christopher Rocha. I have been working in IT for 6 years now. Before that, I have worked various
            jobs across many different industries.
            I have found my calling in technology a long time ago, but didn't quite now in which way to work in the
            field.
            Now, I have found my footing working as a System Engineer for a manufacturing company here in the midwest. I
            have learn many skills and
            technologies, and I fully enjoyed pursuing new skills and learning more each year. I wish to continue to
            expand my skillset, either into
            cloud, coding, or infastructure. No path will remain unexplored before me!
