        <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>

        <p>This is a side project of mine to gain skills in areas such as coding, cloud, CICD pipelines, and git. This site is hosted in Azure using a Static Web Hosting service. It has github CI/CD actions to keep the site up to date when I commit changes to the main branch. It was a lot of fun learning all these tools and incorporating them all together. I would like to shoutout <i>Shawn Wildermuth</i> for his wonderful lessons on web development, particularily his Pluralsight courses. They were extremely helpful and I enjoyed watching them immensely! I will try to keep this site updated as I learn new skills. I would like this site to be a living resume of my work and projects. Thank you, Danielle, for all the support you give me and for putting up with me sitting in my room like a gremlin! And, of course, my little Sadie girl, my supervisor!</p>
